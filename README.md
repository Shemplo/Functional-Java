# Functional library for Java

Function programming is well of their types systems that allows 
to do many checks in compile time. Java also has same mechanism 
but in native use it's much weaker than analogues. This library
gives opportunities to do more checks in Java (mostly for generic types).

Also here will be included main concepts of functional programming:
**Functors**, **Applicatives**, **Monads** and etc.
